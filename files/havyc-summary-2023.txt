The 2023 report on Vermont's young children, titled *The State of Vermont’s Children,* provides an in-depth look at the well-being of families and the effectiveness of the early childhood system in Vermont. The report, developed by Building Bright Futures (BBF), highlights key issues affecting children from prenatal stages through age eight, utilizing data to inform policymakers and support a holistic, data-driven approach to improving family welfare.

### Key Themes and Areas of Focus
1. **Economic Security and Basic Needs**: The report stresses that stable housing, food security, and economic support are essential for children’s development. Vermont continues to experience housing challenges, with rising costs and low vacancy rates. The report advocates for increased investment in affordable housing, adjustments to the Reach Up housing allowance, and development of a Paid Family and Medical Leave program. Food insecurity is highlighted, with various programs, like Universal School Meals and 3SquaresVT, playing critical roles.

2. **Health and Well-Being**: Vermont Medicaid and Dr. Dynasaur programs provide extensive health coverage for children, with additional efforts focused on supporting perinatal health and addressing mental health needs among children. The report discusses initiatives to support children’s preventive health care, dental care, immunizations, and lead screening. Mental health service access is critical, especially with rising behavioral health needs in children, and Vermont faces staffing challenges in mental health services.

3. **Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and Trauma-Informed Care**: Recognizing the impacts of ACEs, the report emphasizes preventive approaches and trauma-informed care to build resilience in children. Vermont is committed to providing supportive systems and policies that address toxic stress and trauma, as well as supporting families and fostering environments that prevent adverse experiences.

4. **Child Development and Education**: Ensuring access to high-quality, inclusive early education is a priority. Recommendations include expanding Universal Pre-K, enhancing support for children with autism and developmental delays, and ensuring inclusive services. The report outlines the importance of early learning opportunities for children’s development and the role of inclusive, accessible education in achieving equity in early childhood.

5. **Data and Accountability**: The BBF emphasizes the need for a well-integrated, data-informed early childhood system. VermontKidsData.org, a centralized data hub, provides high-quality information to support decision-making. The BBF recommends investments in data infrastructure, such as the Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System, to improve the tracking of program outcomes and address service gaps effectively.

### Policy Recommendations
The report contains a series of policy recommendations for 2024 aimed at addressing gaps in Vermont's early childhood system. These include securing sustained funding for data infrastructure, enhancing perinatal and mental health support, expanding access to housing and basic needs, supporting family leadership training, and advancing universal pre-K initiatives to meet the needs of all children and families in Vermont.

Overall, *The State of Vermont’s Children* report serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding the current challenges and opportunities within Vermont’s early childhood system, with a focus on building resilient, equitable communities through collaborative, data-driven policy initiatives.
