THE STATE OF
VERMONT'S CHILDREN
2021 YEAR IN REVIEW
From the

GOVERNOR
Giving kids a healthy start is a priority for me as Governor, laying the foundation for
well-being throughout their lives. Decades of research on brain development shows
investing in Vermont’s youngest children is one of the most critical prevention strategies.
Specifically, it shows supporting a child’s development, education and well-being, as well
as strengthening the communities in which they live, are critical building blocks that set
the stage for healthy relationships, mental and physical health, and social emotional
well-being during early childhood and throughout adulthood. It also plays an important
role in preventing a range of adult outcomes in areas of substance abuse, emergency
department visits, incarceration and unhealthy relationship patterns.

Investment in the early childhood years is an investment in a vibrant, healthy, sustainable economy, which is why early care and learning
is a cornerstone of the cradle to career system of learning we’re building in Vermont.

My vision to support our youngest Vermonters is focused on access to early education and quality opportunities for all children, helping
families get ahead, and strengthening communities to provide safe and healthy environments for children and families. This means
moving toward affordable, high-quality early education for children under 5, and continues with universal prekindergarten education,
kindergarten through grade 3, and after school and out-of-school care.

This year, we continued to make significant investments in child care, building on the significant increases we’ve passed over the last
five years. We also enacted legislation recognizing child care as essential for the development and education of our children as well as
to ensure families with children are able to be at work, and committing to continued use of evidence and data to inform our decision-
making on these issues.

We’ll also continue to prioritize equitable access to universal prekindergarten education, which will help more children enter school with
the developmental, social and emotional readiness to succeed when they get to kindergarten and beyond, setting the foundation for
lifelong learning.

Finally, as we commit to a comprehensive system of services to support children and families, our focus on afterschool, summer
activities and out of school time care will provide children with rewarding and safe opportunities to connect with peers and trusted
adults outside of the classroom, and families with the hours of care needed to fully participate in the workforce.

I’m excited about our efforts to increase economic equity and opportunity across the state, as we work together to build the safest and
healthiest communities for children and families to thrive. We’ve continued to pursue this vision during the COVID-19 pandemic, but I
know the pandemic has widened gaps in our system, and children, parents, educators and providers are still struggling. We’re grateful
to, and proud of, the work of our early childhood workforce during this crisis and are working to ensure our system supports them
alongside children and families.

This report, together with Vermont’s Early Childhood Data and Policy Center, provides another tool for data-driven decision-making for
our kids and their families and can support our collective work as a state to make Vermont the best possible place for children and
families to live.

Very truly yours,

Philip B. Scott
Governor
From the

EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR
It is an honor to serve as the Executive Director of Vermont’s Early Childhood State Advisory
Council Network, Building Bright Futures (BBF). The Network serves as Vermont’s early
childhood public-private partnership charged under State and Federal statute as the State
Advisory Council (SAC), the mechanism used to advise the Governor and Legislature on
the well-being of children in the prenatal period through age 8 and their families.

In this role, it is my responsibility to lead the Network, which includes over 450 early childhood stakeholders and leaders across all
sectors, to assure that policy is developed and decisions are made with the best interest of children and families at the forefront. One of
BBF’s responsibilities is to maintain Vermont’s vision and strategic plan for the early childhood system and monitor progress on child and
family outcomes over time. We do this through Vermont’s Early Childhood Action Plan (VECAP), which serves as the vision and strategic
plan for the early childhood system supporting Vermont children from the prenatal period to age eight and their families (pg, 2).

The ninth iteration of the State of Vermont's Children report is one way in which BBF monitors progress towards the state's vision. The
report includes the 2021-2022 Recommendations of the Vermont Early Childhood State Advisory Council Network, formally endorsed by
the SAC in November 2021; data and context across a range of sectors including but not limited to demographics, basic needs, resiliency
within families and communities, health and well-being, child development and education; and profiles of Vermont’s 12 regions.

The 2021 Data Spotlight is on Vermont’s early childhood workforce crisis, including vacancies and declines in specific early childhood
roles, challenges facing Vermont’s overall labor force, and the unique role that women play in Vermont’s workforce and early childhood
system.

The State of Vermont’s Children report covers many aspects of the state’s early childhood system, but there is often additional data
and context that cannot be included. That is where Vermont’s Early Childhood Data and Policy Center - Vermontkidsdata.org comes in.
Vermontkidsdata.org is a hub of the most high-quality, up-to-date information on the status of children and families across sectors. By
centralizing data from the complex early childhood system, Vermontkidsdata.org makes it easier for leaders, policymakers, families, and
communities to use data to make informed policy and program decisions. More information is available on the back cover of this report.

I hope that together, this report and Vermontkidsdata.org will inspire you in our collective work to improve the lives of children and
families in Vermont, because our children are the future, and the future is bright!

Sincerely,

Morgan K. Crossman, Ph.D., M.A.
Executive Director

THE VERMONT EARLY CHILDHOOD ACTION PLAN

VERMONT’S EARLY CHILDHOOD ACTION PLAN
2020-2025 STRATEGIC PLAN
Vermont aspires to realize the promise of each and every child by ensuring that the early childhood system is an integrated, continuous,
comprehensive, high quality system of services that is equitable, accessible and will improve outcomes for all children in the prenatal period
to age 8and their families in Vermont.

Vermont’s Early Childhood Action Plan (VECAP) is the vision and strategic plan for the early childhood system supporting Vermont
children prenatal to age 8 and their families. The VECAP was updated in 2020 using a lens of equity, access, and common language, with
a commitment to creating positive change in Vermont’s early childhood system. The strategic plan is centered on four common goals,
with strategies and objectives to meet those goals. For the first time, the 2020-2025 VECAP includes outcomes and indicators to monitor
progress. Vermont intends to meet the goals outlined in this cohesive vision by the year 2026, and utilize the BBF Network to establish
shared accountability for achieving statewide priorities.

The VECAP was originally established in 2013 to emphasize the importance of early childhood outcomes and was built on Vermont’s
Guiding Principles which articulate the commitment to fully include each and every child and their family in a continuum of meaningful
experiences to ensure their health, mental health, safety, happiness, and success now and into the future.

In 2020, the early childhood system lost a leader in Mariah McGill (1977-2020). Mariah served as a Regional Coordinator for BBF
and contributed as a keen leader, advocate, and problem solver in other roles throughout the community. Mariah joined the BBF team
in September 2020 and was ebullient with her passion about improving the lives of children and families in Vermont. In her spirit, we
carry on to make true and lasting change.

2 The State of Vermont's Children
VECAP Committee Network
The Vermont Early Childhood Action Plan (VECAP) committee network alongside Vermont’s Early Childhood State Advisory Council
Network (SAC) upholds the vision and strategic plan for Vermont.

The seven VECAP committees are guided by the goals and objectives that Vermont has identified as essential. Committees meet monthly
or as needed each led by a public and private volunteer co-chair. Membership is composed of key stakeholders in the early childhood
system; most committees are open to all early childhood stakeholders. Annually VECAP committees and early childhood partners elevate
gaps and barriers impacting children and families and bring them to the State Advisory Council to make policy recommendations.

RECOMMENDATIONS & STRATEGIES

2021-2022 POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
OF THE VERMONT EARLY CHILDHOOD
STATE ADVISORY COUNCIL NETWORK

The State Advisory Council (SAC) is Vermont’s Governor-appointed, primary advisory body on the well-being of children prenatal
to age eight and their families. In partnership with Vermont’s Early Childhood Action Plan (VECAP) Committees and the Regional
Council Network, the SAC sets priorities, and strategic direction for statewide initiatives using the VECAP and up-to-date data.
The annual SAC recommendations are developed with input across all BBF network gatherings and seeks to identify the current
gaps and needs in policy, promote action in strategic areas for the coming year, ensure recommendations are measurable and
move Vermont toward a more equitable early childhood system. In the 2021 recommendations, the SAC continues to seek
improvement in 5 key policy areas originally outlined at the start of the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2020 and identifies areas where
there are barriers that need a strategy to reach resolution as a step toward policy change:

RESPOND TO
VERMONT’S MENTAL
HEALTH CRISIS

Why it Matters: Early childhood and family mental health is the foundation of all future child development. For many children,
mental health challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic will have both short- and long-term consequences to their
overall health and well-being. This includes children’s capacity to regulate, express emotion, form close, secure relationships,
and to explore the environment and learn. Optimal family mental health with stable and responsive relationships builds a strong
foundation allowing children to develop resilience to ensure that stress is tolerable rather than toxic and to grow into secure,
healthy adults.

Decades of neglect and underinvestment in the systems that address mental health needs across childhood settings have
been exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and must be addressed urgently. The pandemic has highlighted more than ever the
need for increasing mental health resources and supports across settings and in multiple modes. While the need and acuity are
continuing to rise, recruiting and retaining the mental health workforce has escalated from a challenge to a crisis.

ADDRESS CHRONIC
INEQUITIES IN VERMONT’S
EARLY CHILDHOOD SYSTEM

Why it Matters: Equitable access to education-based services, resources, and support for children with mental, emotional,
developmental, and behavioral conditions and special health care needs and their families is critical to creating an optimal
environment for all children and their families. The full implementation of Early Multi Tiered Systems of Support (Early MTSS) will
culturally transform educational settings and encourage true inclusion while also providing structure and support for all children.
Creating this optimal environment also requires a system of services, resources, and supports. While awaiting the recommendations
from Vermont’s Child Care and Early Childhood Education Systems Analysis, there are existing systems that must be maintained.

ELEVATE FAMILIES AS DECISION MAKERS

Why it Matters: Family knowledge, values, beliefs, and cultural backgrounds should always be incorporated into the planning and
delivery of policies and services. Providing parents and caregivers opportunities to express their thoughts and concerns contributes
to an early childhood system that mirrors the diverse needs of Vermont families. It also provides children and future generations the
opportunity to have a voice and be leaders in the creation of the system instead of solely being consumers of resources, services,
and supports. Such partnership and the inclusion of parents and caregivers in critical systems conversations and decision-making
processes ensures families become leaders in designing a responsive system that works for them.

RECOMMENDATIONS & STRATEGIES

DEVELOP A WELL-RESOURCED EARLY
CARE AND EDUCATION SYSTEM

Why it Matters: The COVID-19 pandemic has further illustrated the need to invest in early care and education, universal prekindergarten
(UPK), and out of school time care. There is nation-wide discussion about how to improve, invest, and strengthen the early childhood
system. While Vermont has made significant investments in early care and education, UPK, and out of school time care, it is important
to use this critical moment in time to leverage federal investment and build on the infrastructure already in place.

EVOLVE VERMONT’S EARLY CHILDHOOD DATA
SYSTEM AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Why it Matters: Vermont leaders have recognized that using evidence and data to inform policy is an essential strategy for positively
impacting outcomes for children and families. Although there have been investments in select data systems and development of several
procedures for measuring outcomes, Vermont’s early childhood systems for the collection, analysis, and use of data on the whole remain
inadequate. Vermont must now concretely prioritize and invest in integrated early childhood data systems and procedures to utilize
findings. This is the first step to ensuring the resources, services, and supports currently serving young children and their families are as
effective and efficient as possible. Please note that the results from Vermont’s Child Care and Early Childhood Education Systems Analysis
(July 2022) and the Early Childhood Budget (July 2022) will likely result in recommendations that fall under this umbrella.

The following chapters include key indicators of child and family well-being, many of which show trends
over time. Indicators show a snapshot of the status of children and families, but may not reflect the entire
context impacting outcomes.

DEMOGRAPHICS
Who are Vermont’s young children? How many are there? Where do
they live? These factors are important to take into consideration when
crafting policy and designing programs for children and families.

Early Childhood and Family Mental Health
Mental health is a crucial part of overall health and well-being. Early childhood and family mental health refers to the social, emotional,
and behavioral well-being of young children and their families. This includes the capacity to experience, regulate, and express emotion,
form close, secure relationships, and to explore the environment and learn. Optimal family mental health allows children to develop
the resilience to ensure that stress is tolerable rather than toxic and to grow into well-rounded, healthy adults. For children, mental
health challenges can impact their ability to access school or child care, develop peer relationships, and can have lifelong impacts
without effective supports and/or intervention.

Early Identification and Intervention

Developmental Screening
Developmental screening is a whole population strategy designed to help families better understand their child’s early development, celebrate
milestones, and identify concerns so that young children get connected to the services they need at an early age when the benefit is greatest. Based
on data from Vermont’s statewide medical home initiative, the Blueprint for Health, there has been a steady increase in the percent of Vermont
children under age 3 who received a developmental screening in the past 12 months from 42% in 2013 to 66% in 2019. As can be seen in Figure
52 
21, regional variation exists.
Identifying concerns early through developmental screening and connecting families with concrete supports provides
children the greatest opportunity to overcome any delays and reach their optimal potential. Efforts to increase the use of developmental screenings

REGIONAL PROFILES

ABOUT REGIONAL COUNCILS
Building Bright Futures’ Regional Councils bring together early childhood stakeholders to identify gaps; share expertise and resources
to break down silos; elevate regional and family voice; and implement strategies to respond to the needs of each and every child and
family in their respective area. Regional Council members are crucial to each stage of this process, both in official convenings of the
Regional Councils, and within the early childhood system more broadly.

The 12 Regional Councils are mandated to support an integrated system of early care, health, and education at the local level under
Vermont Statute Title 33 § Chapter 46. In alignment with, and with support from, the State Advisory Council, Regional councils are
tasked with coordinating and implementing services in accordance with system and regional priorities. Regular Regional Council
meetings are just one way that this mandate is fulfilled.

Statewide, nearly 250 people bring their perspectives together through Regional Councils on a monthly basis. Early childhood
stakeholders across regional tables include professionals in physical and mental health, social services, basic needs, early childhood
education, PreK-12 education, families of children under 9, and community members invested in the well-being of young children.

Each Regional Council has an action plan to guide decisions and activities. While each plan supports a local comprehensive early
childhood system, two regional priorities are set by Regional Councils annually to share across the state. The map below presents
the top two priorities of each region which showcases the strength of the regional council network in local priority setting, as well
as the connections and variation between the 12 regions in Vermont.

REGIONAL PROFILES

Introduction to
Regional Profiles
While Vermont is a relatively small state with commonalities across
communities, each region is unique. The following regional profiles
offer a snapshot of selected indicators of child and family well-being
for each of Vermont’s 12 regions. Each indicator includes the most
high-quality, up-to-date data that is available at the regional level and
includes the same data from five years prior for comparison.

Each Regional Council is addressing the early childhood workforce
crisis with a regional focus based on the strengths and opportunities
available as part of the Council Action Plan. Each profile outlines one
way that the Regional Council is addressing these challenges and
moving forward the VECAP Goal 3: All Children and Families Have
Access to High-Quality Opportunities That Meet Their Needs.

For more information on the early childhood workforce crisis, see the
Spotlight starting on page 10.

Please note that due to “test administration during 2020-2021 [being]
impacted by several, novel variables”, proficiency in third grade reading

Addison
To address its priority of early childhood workforce development, the
Addison Regional Council is disrupting the traditional narrative of early
childhood education being a low paying, undervalued profession through
promotion of the resources, advocacy efforts, and pathways to support
entry into the field at this critical moment. The Council is leveraging
the communications power of council members and their networks
and working with the Vermont Association for the Education of Young
Children (VTAEYC) to elevate the visibility of the T.E.A.C.H program, as
well as creating a map of resources and paths to enter the early childhood
workforce. The critical nature of the early childhood workforce has been
highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Addison Council is
determined to support state and national strategies that are regionally
appropriate to recruit, retain, and sustain these essential workers and
professionalize the field of early childhood education. This is just one way
that the Addison Regional Council is moving forward VECAP Goal 3: All
Children and Families Have Access to High-Quality Opportunities That
Meet Their Needs.

REGIONAL PROFILES

Bennington
The Bennington Regional Council is focused on ensuring equitable
access to services for children and families. Two of the strategies
underway address professional development and transportation.
The Council is partnering with Outright Vermont to promote inclusive
practices throughout the Bennington Region. The region-wide training
on Gender inclusive skills and practices for early educators and those
that work with young children offered resources for educators as well
as families, and was created as a pilot that can be expanded throughout
the state moving forward.

Because of the rural nature of the region, for some families, the nearest
services are more than 30 minutes away with no public transportation
option. The Bennington Regional Council is working with regional and
statewide experts to investigate structures and funding opportunities
to potentially form a transportation hub to serve the Bennington
Region. While still in the initial stages of formative research, there
is a clear need for new approaches to accessing services in rural
areas. Concretely addressing the professional development and
transportation needs are only two of the ways the Bennington Regional
Council is moving forward VECAP Goal 3: All Children and Families
Have Access to High-Quality Opportunities That Meet Their Needs.

Caledonia &
Southern Essex
The Caledonia and Southern Essex Regional Council is acutely aware
of the necessity of a skilled and stable workforce in order to meet the
needs of children and families, especially due to the increased needs of
children following the social isolation and potentially toxic stress that
children in the rural Caledonia and Southern Essex region experienced due
to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Council has been gathering information
and discussing how to best support early childhood professionals to
embed resilience strategies in educational, community based, and family
settings. While continuing to identify needs and gaps for early childhood
professionals in the Caledonia and Southern Essex region, the Council is
filling a previously identified gap by continuing to sponsor and support
professional development. The Professional Development subcommittee
adapted the April 2020 Professional Development Conference that was
necessarily postponed into a virtual series which was tailored to the
requests of regional early childhood professionals. Concretely meeting
professional development needs is just one of the ways that the Caledonia
and Southern Essex region is moving forward VECAP Goal 3: All Children
and Families Have Access to High-Quality Opportunities That Meet Their
Needs.

REGIONAL PROFILES

Central Vermont
The focus of the Central Vermont Regional Council is social
connectedness as a way to support and enhance family safety and
mental health. This approach is aligned with the American Academy
of Pediatrics’ October 2021 Declaration of a National Emergency in
Child and Adolescent Mental Health. The workforce challenges for
both specific mental health professionals and the upstream providers
supporting relational health and family resilience are significant in
the Central Vermont region. Previously existing programs grounded in
the Strengthening Families Approach are no longer able to be offered
despite the increased need due to the isolation and stress exacerbated
by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Council is currently completing an
early childhood resource mapping project to inform future council
specific approaches to improving social connectedness as well as
to share with regional partners and the Help Me Grow/211 Resource
Center. The system mapping also includes the current strategies for
information sharing and eligibility criteria for services, resources, and
supports. Mapping the current Central Vermont regional resources
is one way that the Council is moving forward VECAP Goal 3: All
Children and Families Have Access to High-Quality Opportunities
That Meet Their Needs.

Chittenden
The Chittenden Regional Council in collaboration with the Data and
Evaluation VECAP Committee has been actively working to identify
and gather information to address the early childhood education
workforce challenge. In February of 2021,the council hosted a
meeting where a panel of early childhood education program
Directors spoke to their staffing challenges. The council realized that
accurate data was necessary, but unavailable, to inform effective
regional strategies. In response, a series of questions was developed.
At the same time the Data and Evaluation VECAP committee was
working with CDD to review their draft survey for regulated child
care programs. Through the BBF network an effort was made to
integrate these surveys by having a joint discussion resulting in a
joint survey. This use of the BBF Early Childhood Network to reduce
duplication while elevating regional data gaps to inform and align
statewide workforce data collection is just one example of how the
Chittenden Regional Council is moving forward VECAP Goal 3: All
Children and Families Have Access to High-Quality Opportunities

REGIONAL PROFILES

Franklin & Grand Isle
The Franklin and Grand Isle Regional Council set a priority to support
an integrated system of care, with a stable and sustained workforce
as an essential component to success. One strategy for sustaining the
workforce is increasing the understanding of Substance Use Disorder
and its impacts on children and families, as well as the resources
and strategies to support them. As part of the SUD - Making the
Systems Work for Families project, Grand Isle and Chittenden County
professionals have partnered with the Vermont Head Start Association
in bringing a “Training of Trainers” event to VT from the National Center
on Early Childhood Health and Wellness, enhanced with Vermont
specific data, referral and support information from partners in Early
Childhood Mental Health and with leadership from the Chittenden Clinic.
The trainers have since led two virtual trainings for 85 early childhood
professionals with the goals to enhance the skills of the partners, deepen
the understanding of substance use disorder, and reduce stigma in the
community. Embedding resilience strategies through these trainings
along with connections to concrete referral and support information is
one way that the Franklin and Grand Isle Regional Council is sustaining
the early childhood workforce and moving forward VECAP Goal 3: All
Children and Families Have Access to High-Quality Opportunities That
Meet Their Needs.

Lamoille Valley
The Lamoille Valley Regional Council has identified early childhood
workforce development as one of two priorities in line with the focus
of the regional Working Communities Challenge Grant. The focus
on workforce transitions and reducing systemic barriers to work
has led to the implementation of the Step Up to Child Care program
which prepares individuals with the training, internship experience,
and meets the regulatory requirements to enter the
workforce at the end of 16 weeks in partnership with Green
Mountain Technical and Career Center, Northern Lights at CCV,
and the Step up to Child Care Regional Planning Team. In
addition to the fundamentals and CPR/First Aid courses, the
curriculum includes a small business course to enable home
child care providers to be successful and sustainable businesses.
The Step Up to Child Care was originally developed and piloted at
Northeast Kingdom Learning Services. This expanded pilot program
is set to meet the urgent Lamoille Valley regional needs as well as
to determine the feasibility of statewide implementation. This is just
one way that the Lamoille Valley Regional Council is moving

Northern Windsor & Orange
The Northern Windsor and Orange Regional Council has identified early
childhood workforce development as a priority. Recognizing that the early
childhood workforce crisis is not isolated to the Northern Windsor and
Orange region, the council has decided that strategically aligning with upper
valley, statewide, and national efforts may be the best course of action
while ensuring the efforts of the council and council network are regionally
appropriate and meet the urgency of the moment. The first half of this year
has been focused on gathering information from across sectors within and
beyond the early childhood landscape. Experts attending council meetings
to share current data, approaches, and opportunities for collaboration
include representatives from The Department of Labor, Northern Lights
at CCV (early childhood educator professional development), Health Care
and Rehabilitation Services - HCRS (Regional Designated Mental Health
Agency), and the Vermont Association for the Education of Young Children
- VTAEYC. Based on this assessment of regional, statewide, and national
strategies, the council will Identify and execute the most aligned regional
action to address the early childhood workforce crisis. This is just one way

Orleans & Northern Essex
The Orleans and Northern Essex Regional Council has long prioritized
the well-being of the early childhood workforce along with the prevention
of adverse childhood experiences and strengthening resilience. These
priorities are more important than ever due to the increased needs of
children following the social isolation and potentially toxic stress that
children in the rural Orleans and Northern Essex region experienced
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite a lack of funding, the Council’s
Early Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (Early MTSS) subcommittee has
continued to support programs in implementing the tiered social and
emotional development model. The Early MTSS model is beneficial for
children, but also embeds resilience strategies into the classroom for both
children and early childhood professionals. The Council has brought in
the State Director of Trauma Prevention and Resilience Development, to
continue the conversation about addressing stress, resilience, and how to
re-envision well-being for both children and early childhood professionals
through and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Continuing to support the
implementation of Early MTSS as an embedded resilience strategy is just
one way that the Orleans and Northern Essex Council is moving forward

Rutland
The Rutland Regional Council has taken a leadership role in addressing
the workforce crisis, not only in the early childhood fields, but with
stakeholders across sectors throughout Rutland County. The Council
has convened a Workforce Roundtable in order to both align strategies
and streamline the use of limited resources, and to ensure that the
early childhood workforce is included in the larger regional planning.
The working group representatives include the Rutland Chamber of
Commerce, Rutland Regional Medical Center, the Vermont Office of
Workforce Development, the Stafford Technical Center, and United Way.
The Council is also using this opportunity to ensure an equity lens for
the strategies that will be developed as well as conducting the process
and considering what might have been left out of the conversation.
This includes asking questions including “Are there barriers to the
strategies we are recommending?” “Are there any potential unintended
consequences for specific groups/populations?” Collaborating with
partners beyond the early childhood fields while ensuring the use of an
equity lense is just one way that the Rutland Regional Council is moving
forward VECAP Goal 3: All Children and Families Have Access to High-
Quality Opportunities That Meet Their Needs.

Southeast Vermont
The Southeast Vermont Regional Council has long been focused on the
child care shortage through the Child Care Counts Coalition which was
established in 2018 following the Making It Work In Windham Summit
held by the Southeast Vermont Regional Council. After identifying the
workforce shortage as a critical factor in providing high quality child care
in the region in 2021, the Coalition decided on two approaches to meet
the regional needs; bonuses for retaining staff, and sign-on bonuses. As
of October 2021, there were 152 early childhood educators who served
994 children. The Coalition found that existing programs could serve up
to 115 more children if they were able to hire an additional 26 employees
as well as retaining the current educators. This concrete approach to
addressing one aspect of this complex challenge is one of the ways
that the Southeast Vermont region is moving forward VECAP Goal 3:
All Children and Families Have Access to High-Quality Opportunities

Springfield Area
The Springfield Area Regional Council has been prioritizing early
childhood workforce development since 2017. The Council was part of a
regional bid for a Working Communities Challenge Grant, and in 2019, the
Springfield Area was awarded one of four grants focused on increasing
the workforce. The Child Care Counts Coalition (CCC) model that began
in Southeast Vermont has expanded to the Springfield Area based on
the needs identified by the Regional Council. The CCC comes together
monthly with leaders across and beyond the early childhood landscape to
address the intertwined systems that contribute to a lack of child care and
currently on recruiting and retaining the skilled early childhood educator
workforce. While the CCC has been specifically focused on the child care
workforce, the Regional Council has been able to focus on the larger
early childhood workforce to increase family access. The Springfield
Area Regional Council is well aware of the entrenched challenges and
the critical nature of including both statewide and national strategies as
well as making sure that the work is appropriate for the region. Bringing
these two approaches together to address the early childhood workforce
crisis is one example of how the Springfield Area Regional Council is
moving forward VECAP Goal 3: All Children and Families Have Access
to High-Quality Opportunities That Meet Their Needs.

38 The State of Vermont's Children
LIMITATIONS

The State of Vermont’s Children: 2021 Year in Review presents the most high quality, up-to-date data available as of December
2021. However, there are several limitations worth noting.

Proxy Measures: Due to the small population of Vermont and the current data infrastructure, proxy measures from national
datasets and indicators that capture only a small part of the picture are standard. For example, mental health services and child
care utilization data is available and reported, but the demand for these services is not currently measured.

Timeframes: The timing of data collection and reporting varies among programs. Not all data reported is from the same year
or time period, but instead, captures a range of indicators from the last three years and includes state and federal fiscal years,
calendar years, school years, and point-in-time counts.

Age ranges: Datasets focus on different age ranges that may or may not be comparable across programs. For example, some
datasets and programs focus on children prenatal to age three, while others capture data on children prenatal to age six or age
eight, and others are only available for children under 18.

The COVID-19 pandemic: The pandemic has affected the availability and quality of data. As programs have changed in
response to evolving needs, the monitoring and evaluation systems have been slow to be updated. It may take years to
determine if the changes that have occurred starting in March 2020 will be outliers, or the start of new trends.

Vermont’s Early Childhood System is eagerly awaiting the data specific recommendations of Vermont’s Child Care and Early
Childhood Education Systems Analysis to address some of the systemic data challenges outlined above.

42 The State of Vermont's Children
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The State of Vermont’s Children: 2021 Year in Review is truly a collaborative effort.

On behalf of the Vermont Early Childhood State Advisory Council Network, I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to the
following agencies, stakeholders and organizations for their contributions to developing content, identifying and sharing key
topics, and providing data:

The Vermont Agency of Education, the Vermont Care Partners Data Repository, the Vermont Department for Children and Families;
Child Development Division, Children’s Integrated Services, Economic Services Division, Family Services Division, the Office of
Economic Opportunity, and the Vermont Head Start Collaboration Office, the Vermont Commission on Women, the Vermont
Department of Health, the Vermont Department of Mental Health, Change the Story Vermont, Help Me Grow Vermont, Hunger Free
Vermont, Let’s Grow Kids, the Parent Child Center Network, Vermont Afterschool and the Vermont Head Start Association. Thank
you as well to the many families who shared the photographs that we have been able to include in this year’s report! I am also
grateful to the Building Bright Futures State Advisory Council, the 12 Regional Councils, and the 7 Vermont Early Childhood Action
Plan Committees for their collaboration and guidance.

I would also like to recognize the work of the Building Bright Futures (BBF) staff as a whole. First by thanking the Regional
Managers for their content expertise throughout the report and for sharing the incredible work each council is doing through
the regional profiles. In addition, this report would not be successful without the work of our administrative staff including BBF’s
Office and Finance Managers, Katie Mobbs and Allison Oskar. Finally, I would especially like to thank three key contributors.
First, this year’s report would not have been possible without the many contributions of Beth Truzansky, BBF’s Deputy Director in
creating thoughtful alignment between the report and Vermont’s Early Childhood Action Plan (VECAP), content development and
editing. Second, Anna Brouillette, BBF’s Policy and Program Director for collaborating with the Vermont Commission on Women
and Change The Story for the Spotlight on the Early Childhood Workforce Crisis and her grammatical expertise. Lastly, Dora
Levinson, BBF’s Research and Data Director, for executing all aspects of this year’s report from statistical expertise, partnering
with data stewards, navigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on data availability and comparability, and contributing
her content expertise throughout the report. Thank you all for your dedication, expertise and adaptability as we developed this
important publication.

I continue to be inspired by our collective commitment to using the most up-to-date, high-quality data to inform policy and service
provision for young children and their families.
