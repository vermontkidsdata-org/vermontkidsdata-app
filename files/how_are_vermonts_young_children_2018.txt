2018 REPORT

How are Vermont’s
Young Children
and Families?
FROM THE GOVERNOR

Thank you for taking the time to review the sixth edition
of How Are Vermont’s Young Children and Families report,
which is produced each year by Vermont’s early childhood
State Advisory Council, Building Bright Futures (BBF).
This year’s report documents successes and challenges
facing young children and their families, as well as promising
strategies currently underway in Vermont to improve
outcomes. It includes regional profiles, data trends and
priority actions in communities around the state. There
is much to celebrate — from a significant increase in the
percent of high quality child care programs, to having
one of the highest rates of children with health insurance in the country. The report also
recommends opportunities for improvement, including addressing the impact of Adverse
Childhood Experiences (ACEs), increasing access to quality child care, and making child care
more affordable for families.

My administration is focused on making Vermont more affordable, growing our economy,
and protecting our most vulnerable. Prioritizing the security of children and families is
at the center of all these goals.

We know from the science on brain development that investing in children early on pays
dividends for them, and our economy, down the road. Ensuring the availability of affordable
child care will also draw young professionals to Vermont.

The opioid epidemic, and related increases in the rate of young children in custody, continues
to be one of Vermont’s biggest challenges and we are all too aware of the impact on families
and especially vulnerable young children. The recommendations in this report outline how
we can support the social-emotional development of children and promote resilience to
protect them from the long-term effects of trauma.

My hope is that the data shared in this report will help improve our shared understanding
of how young Vermonters and their families are faring. Ensuring the well-being of our
youngest children makes Vermont an even better place to raise a family, and it supports
a growing economy. I hope this report will inspire you to join us in this work. The path
forward requires us to work together, pulling in the same direction toward our shared
goals for Vermont’s children and families.

Very truly yours,

Philip B. Scott
Governor

FROM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

It is an honor to serve as the Executive Director of Building
Bright Futures, Vermont’s early childhood public-private
partnership. Through Act 104, (33 V.S.A 4602) we are
empowered to monitor the state’s early care, health and
education system by tracking and reporting data on the
well-being of children families, and to advise the Legislature
and Administration on policy and systems improvements.
Our How Are Vermont’s Young Children and Families report
is a cornerstone of how we meet this important charge.

This data-driven report has been a hallmark of our work
for the past six years, looking at key indicators and trends
in child and family well-being. It stands as a valuable resource chronicling the well-being
of children and articulating strategies and recommendations to improve outcomes across
health, early care and learning, community and family economic well-being.

In our 2018 report, we highlight the importance of promoting protective factors and
the positive social and emotional development of children, as well as the need to expand
capacity in Vermont’s early care and learning system. Additionally, new data points have
been included that better illuminate conditions for children, such as third grade reading
and math scores, developmental screening data, and information on childhood obesity
and screen time. We’ve also added an introductory chapter on demographics.

The well-being of children and families is the best barometer for our economic future
and how we are doing as a society. This year’s report provides a snapshot of how we are
doing, and calls us to recommit to our strong, shared vision for Vermont children
and their families laid out in the Early Childhood Action
Plan. We look forward to continuing to work side
by side with our communities, public and private
providers, state partners, and the legislature.
After all, our collective work to create real
and lasting change for Vermont’s children and
families is arguably the most important work
we can do for a better future — and when we
work together, children shine.

Sincerely,

Sarah Squirrell
Executive Director

PURPOSE STATEMENT
The purpose of this document is to report on the current state of Vermont’s young children
and families. We hope the information shared will inspire interest, involvement, and action
among Vermont’s government leaders, service providers, educators, parents and caregivers,
and greater community members. Together we can collectively support a safe, healthy,
and prosperous future for Vermont.
In addition to data on the well-being of young children and families, each chapter concludes
with Strategies to Turn the Curve, a section dedicated to highlighting actions underway
around the state that help improve child outcomes. The report concludes with a
Recommendations chapter, which is intended to inform readers and decision-makers on
systems-level strategies that will support greater success for children and families.

Peppered throughout this report are pictures of children and caregivers from Sara Holbrook Community Center, a BBF partner.

The distribution of males and females in Vermont’s

48.3% of all children under 9; males represented 51.7%.
The racial makeup of Vermont’s children has also

than Vermont’s population as a whole (see Table 1).

Strategies to Turn the Curve

Vermont’s Early Childhood Action Plan outlines several
strategies to strengthen family and community
environments for Vermont children:
n Support families as children’s primary caregivers
n Engage with families as their child’s first and most
important teacher
n Promote and utilize evidence-based home visiting
n Develop community efforts in the public and private
sectors to enhance children’s safety
Below are several actions underway in Vermont to
implement these strategies. All of these strategies are

can provide a helpful picture of how we are doing
at supporting young children in the early childhood
continuum from birth to age eight. At the end of the
2016-2017 school year, 52% of third graders were

Addison Region
About the Region

In the Addison Region the number of children living in poverty and in DCF custody under the age
of 9 continues to increase, despite a decline in population of children. The region struggles with
food insecurity, substance abuse, a persistent lack of high quality infant care, and a shortage of
people entering the early childhood education workforce. Addison County is very rural, and a lack
of transportation and affordable housing is a struggle for many.
REGIONAL PRIORITIES
The collaboration and integration of the BBF and Integrated Family Services infrastructures and
community-wide focus on social-emotional development are tremendous assets to the community.
The Council is focused on:
n Working with area businesses and pediatricians to explore new ways to support and fund child care
n Ways to attract and retain employees to the field of early care and education
n Holding several trainings in the area using the Pyramid Model for Supporting Social Emotional
Competence in Infants and Young Children

Bennington Region
About the Region

The Bennington Region is led by a diverse, involved council that annually prioritizes the outcomes in
Bennington’s regional plan using current data and regional concerns. 43.7% of children under the age
of 6 in the region live below 200% of poverty, which can be a determining factor in children being
ready for school. Children receiving free or reduced lunch are less likely to be ready for school in five
developmental areas. Bennington has again seen an increase in the number of children in DCF custody.
REGIONAL PRIORITIES
To counteract these effects, Bennington has focused on:
n Continual professional development for early childhood providers. Because of this focus,
Bennington has a high rate of STARS participation, which increased to 83.6%.
n Building strong social-emotional skills has been a long-standing priority in the Bennington region.
The professional development committee has provided knowledge and skills in this area, leading
to environments that promote social emotional health.

Caledonia & Southern Essex Region
About the Region

The Caledonia and Southern Essex region (which aligns with the St. Johnsbury AHS District) is a
beautiful, rural area in the Northeast Kingdom that is rich in outdoor recreation opportunities.
The 2016 population of children under 9 in the 24 towns in the region is 3,048, making up 46.6% of the
under 18 population. It also has some of the highest poverty rates in the state. There is a continued
increase in children in DCF custody, many because of parental substance use. The BBF Regional Council
is comprised of a diverse group with representation from registered and licensed child care programs,
school districts, health, mental health, libraries, and families.
REGIONAL PRIORITIES
Based on current data, the Council has highlighted several strategies to address concerns and to
enhance community connectedness for all families, including:
n School readiness activities
n Promotion of the Strengthening Families Protective Factors framework
n Offering on-going, advanced professional development opportunities

Central Vermont Region
About the Region

The Central Vermont Building Bright Futures Region includes almost all of Washington County and
several towns in northern Orange County. Home to the state capital of Montpelier, the region, which
shares boundaries with the Barre AHS district, has both urban and rural challenges. Growing income
inequality in the region and across the state, combined with an increased understanding of the social
determinants of health, have highlighted how poverty drives outcomes for young families and
children in the region.
REGIONAL PRIORITIES
Working collaboratively with partners at the local and state level, the Central Vermont Council
is focused on:
n Improving child care capacity and quality

Chittenden Region
About the Region

Chittenden County is very populous and includes Vermont’s largest city, Burlington. It’s no surprise
that many choose to live close to where they can easily find employment and access commercial
and cultural centers. Chittenden County is rich in diversity, including race, socio-economic status,
and the often overlooked rurality of its smaller towns.
REGIONAL PRIORITIES
The Chittenden Regional Council is focused on:
n Improving communication among the family-serving organizations, and what we call our Circles
of Influence, to enhance our collective impact
n Improving service delivery and integrated support for children and families impacted by substance
use disorder, and working across sectors to identify systemic gaps
n Promoting inclusion of diverse families by offering training, writing about best practices, and
promoting the use of Vermont’s Guiding Principles for Supporting Each and Every Young Child and
Family’s Full and Equitable Participation

Franklin Grand Isle Region
About the Region

Franklin and Grand Isle counties’ rolling hills contain both isolated poverty and wealthier communities.
The level of commitment to improve outcomes for children and families is robust across the region.
The BBF council, and other tables where stakeholders gather, are consistently gathering data to inform
the direction of their efforts. A wide range of variables contribute to a significantly higher number of
children in DCF custody than in past years, which is why the region takes a multi-pronged approach
to supporting vulnerable populations.
REGIONAL PRIORITIES
The Franklin and Grand Isle Council has been focused on:
n Continuing to increase the number of early care and learning programs in the STARS program
n Promoting kindergarten readiness
n Identifying and providing concrete supports to families in areas of food insecurity and affordable,
stable housing, and working to mitigate the risks and reduce the likelihood of families
experiencing homelessness

Lamoille Valley Region
About the Region

The Lamoille Valley Region shares boundaries with the Morrisville AHS district, covering fifteen towns
which range from one of Vermont’s wealthiest, to some of the state’s poorest communities. A focus
on collaboration, communication, and coordination among organizations supporting early childhood
continues to be a strength in the region. Areas for concern include a lack of child care capacity and
finding and developing early care professionals. The costs of child care are high, and the wages in
the field remain low. While child custody rates remain low in the region, the percentage of children
in custody who are very young is rising — mirroring a similar and ongoing trend across Vermont.
REGIONAL PRIORITIES
The Lamoille Valley Council is focused on three primary areas:
n Parent education
n Monitoring and measuring how the early childhood system supports young families
n Increasing communication and cooperation for those providing supports for families and
young children

Northern Windsor & Orange Region
About the Region

The Northern Windsor and Orange County region, which shares boundaries with the Hartford AHS
district, has pockets of densely populated areas along with some very rural areas, and faces challenges
surrounding income inequality. The region also has families accessing services in a variety of counties
including Windsor, Orange, and Washington, as well as across the border in New Hampshire. This can
cause difficulty for families navigating through the system or for providers creating partnerships.
REGIONAL PRIORITIES
The council has focused on:
n Addressing the increasing numbers of children under the age of six living in poverty and those
in DCF custody
n Supporting outreach around WIC and promotion of the Early Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS)
n Despite the increase in the number of high-quality child care programs in this region, there are
challenges in workforce recruitment and retention in the early childhood sector. The council has
also made improvement in this area of focus.

About the Region

The Orleans and Northern Essex (ONE) counties contains some of Vermont’s most beautiful natural

our lakes and mountains. However, the region also has the state’s highest child poverty rates and
poorest health outcomes.
REGIONAL PRIORITIES
The ONE Regional Council implements an annual process of selecting priority strategies by reviewing
current data and assessing community needs. The council is focused on:
n Continuing to prioritize the social and emotional skill-building for caregivers and children through
our regional Early MTSS pilot project and demonstration sites
n Promoting, supporting and creating high-quality child care in our region
n Increasing family supports by addressing food insecurity, promoting social connections and
child development, and resource sharing through initiatives like the Welcome Baby Bag pilot project
at two pediatric offices, and support for the Troy and Newport Promise Communities

Rutland Region
About the Region

The Rutland Region covers all of Rutland County, the second most populated county in the state.
The region is a combination of rural and urban areas where income levels fall below the state median.
While the population of youth under 9 years old is falling, the number of children in DCF custody is
on the rise. Child care providers report an increase in children with social-emotional needs. Like many
other regions, Rutland struggles with food insecurity, affordable housing, and transportation, along
with a lack of access to affordable high quality infant care.
REGIONAL PRIORITIES
The Rutland BBF Council is focused on:
n Working with the local WIC office to help increase access to healthy foods
n Working with the Stern Center for Language and Learning to train area members in the
BUILDING BLOCKS FOR LITERACY® program
n The council is forming a kindergarten Readiness Team to make the transition to school a positive
one for children, families, and teachers.

Southeast Vermont Region
About the Region

The Southeast Vermont region has a vibrant early childhood landscape, including a large proportion
of high quality early care and learning programs, dedicated service providers, and collaboration
and investment from school districts, healthcare providers, and more recently, local businesses.
The dedication and collaboration are highlighted in the annual Month of the Child in the area
and increased promotion of resources. Even with this investment, both the proportion of children
under 6 living in poverty and the children in DCF custody have increased between 2010 and 2016.
These indicators shine a light on the overall health of children and families.
REGIONAL PRIORITIES
For 2019, the Regional Council, in collaboration with other groups and organizations, will focus on:
n Increasing child care capacity
n Maternal and child health, including social-emotional development
n Pre-kindergarten policy
n Child and family safety

Springfield Region
About the Region

The Springfield Region contains towns in northern Windham County and Southern Windsor County,
sharing boundaries with the Springfield AHS district. The Springfield region has experienced increasing
rates of poverty, unemployment, and income inequity since the loss of many of its manufacturing jobs
with few replacement jobs. Despite this, or perhaps due to this, the region has a long history of working
collaboratively with a variety of sectors to better the community, and that includes those serving our
young children and families. The Springfield area once had low rates of STARS participation and high
quality childcare but now holds some of the highest rates.
REGIONAL PRIORITIES
The Springfield Area Council has dedicated its work in:
n Helping families meet their basic needs
n Assisting caregivers accessing opportunities to understand, and providing family events that
support, child development
n Working with the VT Department of Health to promote WIC and the developmental screening registry

early childhood stakeholders, organizations,
and agencies in Vermont.
We would especially like to thank the Vermont
Department for Children and Families, the Vermont
Department of Health, the Vermont Department of
Mental Health, and the Vermont Agency of Education
for their support with content development and data
identification. The report team would also like to
recognize the work of the BBF community and staff,
including BBF’s Data and Evaluation Committee, for
their work developing content, and helping to identify
key partners to include in the project; the BBF Vermont
Insights Director Nick Adams and Vermont Data
Coordinator Dora Levinson for their work collecting
and analyzing the numerous datasets in the report;
BBF’s 12 regional councils and their coordinators for
their support developing this year’s regional profiles;
and the members of the BBF State Advisory Council
for their support and guidance.

We would also like to thank BBF Communications
Director, Julia Andrews, for her leadership in managing
the compilation and editing of the report and BBF
Deputy Director Carolyn Wesley for her support in
