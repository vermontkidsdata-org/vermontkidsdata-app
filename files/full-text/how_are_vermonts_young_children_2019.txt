2019 REPORT

How are Vermont’s
Young Children
and Families?
FROM THE GOVERNOR

Thank you for taking the time to review the seventh edition
of How Are Vermont’s Young Children and Families?, to learn
about the state of the state for Vermont’s children, birth to
age 8. This report is compiled annually by Vermont’s early
childhood State Advisory Council, Building Bright Futures (BBF).
It serves as an important resource to bring Vermonters together
to focus on the successes and challenges for our youngest
children and their families.

My administration is focused on creating a more affordable
Vermont and growing our economy while also protecting our
most vulnerable citizens. Creating a strong future for children is at the center of all these goals.
The science on brain development shows the importance of investing in our young children
as it sets the foundation for life course outcomes, not only for individual children but also for
a strong community and a vibrant economy. My vision for a cradle to career system recognizes
this critical period of development. We are working to realize this vision in part by creating
more affordable, high-quality child care that supports parents’ full participation in the economy.

This year’s report provides a snapshot of the current status of young children in our state,
and highlights promising strategies underway. It includes data trends, regional snapshots,
and priority actions taking place around the state. The data in this report provide a basis for
shared understanding about Vermont’s young children and the systems that support their
success. The rise of children in protective custody, the growing number of children served
by the state’s designated mental health agencies, the rate of young children with social,
emotional or behavioral health conditions, and the growing need for high-quality child
care and early childhood workforce continue to be some of our greatest challenges.

There are high points to celebrate, such as making child care more affordable and improving
quality of care over several years, in addition to opportunities for improvement reflected in
the recommendations in key areas such as child and family mental health and supporting
the workforce that cares for Vermont’s children. The recommendations outline how we can
take a proactive approach to early childhood and family mental health, provide children
with the support they need to lay the groundwork for social-emotional development, and
support the needs of our early childhood workforce.

Ensuring the well-being of children makes Vermont an even better place to work,
live, and raise a family. My hope is that this report inspires you to join in our collective
work as a state to make Vermont the best place possible for children and families.

Very truly yours,

Philip B. Scott
Governor

FROM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

It is an honor to serve as the Executive Director of Building Bright Futures (BBF),
Vermont’s foundational early childhood public-private partnership, mandated
by state and federal legislation, to serve as the State Advisory Council on Early
Childhood. Through Act 104, BBF is charged with (1) bringing together key
stakeholders to engage in discussions about how to best coordinate and
enhance the early childhood system of services to meet the diverse needs
of all young children, (2) monitoring Vermont’s early childhood system
including health, early care and education, and (3) using the most
up-to-date, high quality data to advise the Governor, Legislature
and administration on the system of services and the well-
being of children birth to age 8 and their families. This seventh
edition of How Are Vermont’s Young Children and Families is a cornerstone of how we meet
this important obligation.

In our 2019 report, we highlight key recommendations brought forth by the State Advisory
Council within two key priority areas: supporting the early care and education workforce
and supporting the mental health of children and families. Both priority areas emphasize
the early childhood period as the foundation for future development and lifelong outcomes
for children and families. New to the report this year is a Spotlight on Early Childhood and
Family Mental Health, which reflects one of the State Advisory Council’s annual priorities
and the critical, ever-growing need for mental health support for children and their families.
Over the last year, a cross-sector Early Childhood Mental Health Task Force came together to
develop recommendations and promote strategies to proactively support the development
of resilience in children. This crucial work emphasizes prevention, based in the Strengthening
Families Approach, to help Vermont’s children thrive in our communities and beyond.

The well-being of children is an important way we can measure our success as a society. Ensuring
optimal developmental outcomes and well-being for our youngest children is a vital role and can help
us to grow a healthy economy and community. This report provides a snapshot of how we are doing
and is designed to be a useful tool for state and local government leaders, service providers, parents
and caregivers, educators, and other community members dedicated to ensuring our children’s success.
It highlights our collective strengths and areas for improvement as well as strategies in place to move toward
an even brighter future for Vermont families. We look forward to working together with families, communities,
partner organizations, and lawmakers to best support the children and families of our state. I hope this report
inspires you to join in this valuable endeavor. The collective contributions of Vermont’s leaders are our best
opportunity to lay a strong foundation in the early years of life, securing benefits well into the future.

Sincerely,

Morgan Crossman, Ph.D., M.A.
Executive Director

Children in Protective Custody
When a child’s safety is threatened and that threat is
substantiated, the child may be placed in the custody of
the Department for Children and Families (DCF), Family
Services Division. Custody arrangements vary; the child
may remain at home with supportive services, or be placed
with a relative or foster family, as can be seen in Figure 5.
Since 2012 the number of children in custody has steadily

Strategies to Turn the Curve

To better support Vermont’s children and families,
there are several strategies outlined in Vermont’s
Early Childhood Action Plan:
n Support families as children’s primary and most
important teachers
n Provide families support where they are: at home,
through medical homes, and in early care and
learning environments
n Build resilience in children and families to prevent
or counteract toxic stress
n Build resilience by investing in promotion of health

Strategies to Turn the Curve

Vermont’s Early Childhood Action Plan outlines
several strategies to improve access to the state’s
early care and learning programs, and also to
improve quality:
n Expand access to high-quality services and programs
for all families with young children by increasing
quality, capacity, and affordability
n Strengthen quality of early childhood services
throughout the early childhood system via
a focus on alignment and best practices
n Ensure quality by adequately supporting the early

n Ensure access to prenatal care and child health services,
including preventative services and dental care,
and support services for adults including mental health

About the Regions
BBF has 12 Regions within Vermont, each with its own Regional Council
working to implement strategies that serve the unique priorities of
their area and also align with statewide issues. The Regional Councils
bring together a wide range of stakeholders including professionals in
education, healthcare, early care, and social services in addition to parents
and community members that share wisdom and experience to create
collective strategies that serve children and families. Statewide, nearly 250
people bring their perspectives together on Regional Councils.

Addison Region
About the Region

The Addison region works independently to improve outcomes for children and families and
collaborates with regional partners to integrate the Building Bright Futures and Integrated Family
Services Councils, creating a continuum of care for children birth to age 21. The number of children
in need of special services continues to climb, perhaps driven by family economic stressors caused
by a lack of affordable housing, limited transportation, and lack of high-quality child care spaces
available, especially for infants. The region has a significant child care workforce shortage, affecting
the region’s economy. Addison Council’s public awareness and education campaign, “OK, You’ve
Got This,” has worked to support families and help children believe in their ability to handle life’s
inevitable challenges.
This year the council supported:

n Supports for families dealing with the effects of trauma and poverty

Bennington Region
About the Region

Bennington County has a long history of cooperation with families, organizations, and programs to
support positive outcomes for children and families. Bennington has a high rate of poverty, maternal
depression, and children in DCF custody. These indicators affect the economic well-being of the region and
the resilience of children and families. Bennington’s council identified early detection, early intervention,
workforce development, and social-emotional health for children and their families as regional priorities.
In support of this Bennington has:
n Piloted the Devereux Early Childhood Assessment. The Professional Development Committee is
advancing additional cross-sector learning opportunities including Pyramid Model trainings and Flip-it.
n Provided cross-sector professional development to ensure a well-trained workforce with a common
language and expectations.
n Supported building capacity to serve all children needing specialized services (CIS) and a smooth
transition to school-based services. Bennington’s CIS team supported the increase in children
receiving early intervention services.

Caledonia & Southern Essex Region
About the Region

The Caledonia & Southern Essex BBF Council is comprised of a diverse group of community partners
that are dedicated to enhancing services and experiences for young children and their families, as well
as the providers that care for them.

The region has a high percentage of children under age 6 living below 200% of the federal poverty
level. The impact to the physical and mental well-being of families due to financial insecurity, and
continuing to decrease the number of children in DCF custody, are priority areas.

The Council is supporting many community-based parenting programs that support families to meet
their children’s developmental needs.

The Council’s Professional Development committee is focusing on supporting child care workforce
development by increasing the number of advanced-level professional development opportunities
offered in the area.

Chittenden Region
About the Region

The Chittenden Council strives to provide opportunities for all voices to have a place at meeting
tables and community events. In 2019, the Council formally adopted the value of addressing its work
through an equity lens, because our children, families, and communities are rich in diversity.
The Council focused on two initiatives that are impactful in establishing inclusive practices to
support each and every child and family:
n A Collective Impact project to improve and integrate supports and services for children and
families seeking treatment for substance use disorder. The Council convened a Community of
Practice (CoP) planning team of expert partners.
n Addressing the increasing need for training to support early childhood providers that are serving
more high-needs children. In partnership with Help Me Grow and community collaborators,
the Council has trained over 100 early childhood professionals in Early Multi-Tiered Systems
of Support.

Franklin / Grand Isle Region
About the Region

In the northwestern part of the state, the families of Franklin and Grand Isle counties continue to
trail blaze in areas of perinatal, early childhood, and overall family mental health, while also working
to reduce food insecurity, support early childhood development, and engage an active, motivated
network of early care providers.

The STARS high-quality ratings among child care centers, both in-home and center-based, are at
the highest percentage they have ever been. The region’s population of children under 6 remains
consistent and the percentage of children living in poverty has dropped nearly 15% over a two-
year period.

The region’s BBF council has made food security a constant mission, facilitating local food, toiletry,
and infant care drives to benefit food shelves. Additionally, the council has worked to create
trauma-informed family visitation rooms at the local DCF offices to offer a safe space to promote
healthy family interactions and developmentally-informed activities.

Lamoille Valley Region
About the Region

In the past year, The Lamoille Valley community has come together to support families and develop
a shared agenda. The Lamoille Council is particularly invested in building resources for families
experiencing homelessness, poverty, and substance use disorder. The council also recognizes that
poverty hurts Vermont’s children, often resulting in a range of poor long-term outcomes.

At the council table, the agenda continues to focus on three areas to improve outcomes for children
and families: increasing child care quality and capacity, especially for infants and toddlers; investment
in elevating family voice and leadership opportunities; and working to tip the scale to mitigate the
challenges of poverty so that children can reach their full potential.

Additionally, the Council underscored the critical and continued support and investment in Children’s
Integrated Services (CIS) to support all families in need.

Northern Windsor & Orange Region
About the Region

The Northern Windsor and Orange County region has a large network of partners that span state
lines and defined catchment areas encompassing communities with diverse characteristics. The
region struggles to find workforce to fill child care provider positions and as a result, is experiencing
a decline in the number of child care facilities open. The region notices a need to support children’s
social and emotional development with stressors in the community such as poverty, substance use,
and familial stress.
This year the council worked to:
n Increase community awareness of adverse childhood experiences through screenings of the film
Resilience and educational events
n Increase child care providers’ skills to promote social and emotional development by providing
training in Early Multi-Tiered Systems of Support
n Promote a deeper understanding and use of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire and use of the
Universal Developmental Screening Registry

Orleans & Northern Essex Region
About the Region

The Orleans & Northern Essex Region’s leaders are committed to improving the lives of young
children and their families. A focus of the Council is on informing early childhood professionals and
parents about the impact of poverty and trauma on infant brain development and early childhood
social-emotional development.

In partnership with the Building Flourishing Communities group, the Council is advancing
community-led action and strategies aimed at preventing adverse childhood experiences and
strengthening resilience.

More than half of children under age 6 are living in poverty, the highest rate of all regions, and
significantly higher than the state rate of 38%. Job security is a factor in assisting families to move
out of poverty; access to childcare plays an important role in keeping employment.

The Regional Council has identified child care capacity and workforce development as another
priority area, due to the lack of child care programs in the region.

Rutland Region
About the Region

The Rutland region is a combination of rural and urban areas and is the second largest county
in Vermont. The Regional Council is a diverse group of partners working to ease the lasting effects
of childhood trauma and poverty. The Council acknowledges that early educators need more
support as they support children and families with challenging behaviors and life circumstances,
including children impacted by Adverse Childhood Experience (ACEs), mental health challenges,
and incarcerated family members. The region saw the rate of children under 9 in DCF custody
rise despite the fact that the population of children in that age group decreased.
This year the council worked to:
n Promote literacy with the Stern Center’s Building Blocks for Literacy training for early
educators as they work with children birth to five to become successful literacy learners
n Support successful kindergarten transitions for children, families and educators
n Support professional development of the workforce

Southeast Vermont Region
About the Region

The Southeast Vermont region is both fiercely independent and highly collaborative. The region has
an aging workforce, a shrinking population, a consistently high number of children in DCF custody,
and almost half of all children under 6 living in poverty. Agencies, organizations, businesses, and
individuals continue to come together to mitigate the impacts of trauma and poverty on children
and families. Community leaders are developing innovative approaches by working together with
a common goal of supporting resilience of children, families, and our communities.
Two collaborative efforts the council has supported this year are:
n The launch of The Basics, an evidence-based community saturation campaign to cultivate greater
early childhood brain development through quality interactions between children from birth to
age 3 and parents and caregivers.
n Formation of the Advisory Committee for the Early Childhood Education Pathway at the Windham
Regional Career Center where students will be able to graduate with up to 24 early childhood
college credits and up to two years of classroom experience.

Springfield Area Region
About the Region

The Springfield Area has a strong sense of working together across sectors to improve outcomes
for children despite persistent challenges, including poverty and other factors (almost half our
children under 9 live 200% below the poverty line) and a high number of adults reporting poor
mental health. To support families through these challenges, the Council intentionally partners to
create and strengthen programs such as the Welcome Baby Bag project and Same Page Initiative.
The Council recognizes the importance of family engagement and building relationships among
partners including Supervisory Unions, child care providers, and families to mitigate these impacts
and support thriving children.
This year the council worked to:
n Strengthen the nutritional education that child care providers deliver with the Women Infants
and Children (WIC) Program
n Support family engagement activities through festivals, parenting classes, and local trips to
support family needs and provide child development education

Mental Health, and Let's Grow Kids.

I would also like to recognize the work of the BBF staff
